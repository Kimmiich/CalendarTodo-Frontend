# CalendarTodo-Frontend

This is the frontend part of an exercise within the course javascript 2.

## Background

In this project weâ€™re asked to build a frontend with react where we display a calendar and todolist combined.

The calendar is in monthly spread and also shows current/choosen day. All todos is displayed in both calendar views and also in its own component.
You can delete, add and mark a todo as done. By clicking the "+"
marker on a day in the calendar you automatically get the date in New todo form.

## Launch demo

The frontend is provided through heroku and can be tested [here.](https://kimmie-cal-front.herokuapp.com/)

## Installation

> Feel free to clone this repo and look at it locally.

I recommend using **VS code**, there you can use the live-server option too see local changes etc.
